# Data Structures

- [x] make a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms.
- [x] Create a new branch in your repo called linked-list.
- [x] Your top-level readme should contain a “Table of Contents” navigation to all of  challenges .
- [x] Place this implementation in your Data-Structures folder within  repository.
- [x] a folder named linked_list which contains a file called linked_list.py.
- [x] Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- [x] Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- [x] Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
- [x] Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
- [x] Write tests to ensure your code is doing well.
