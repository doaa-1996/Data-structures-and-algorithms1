Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

# Approach and efficiency
 
Take the middle of the array and do a concatination from first to middle and then insert the value and from middle to end

Time complexity=O(1)
